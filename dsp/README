Hello you poor unfortunate soul reading this!
Custom built header files are in the "header" directory and all source files are under "src" (creative, I know).
In order to compile and run the program, do the following:
	- "make" in this directory will build the standard program
	- "make CFG=debug" will compile a debig version with logging options and the IM model will
		be included in the control loop (i.e. you don't need a motor)
	- "make clean" will provide a clean slate and remove all build objects
One compile, a target file is generated named "build", to run this program, you need to be a superuser:
	- "sudo ./build", this is because the program needs to access the BBB memory directly
	- If you built a debug version of the code, follow the command line instructions

GL HF! As the kids would say...
