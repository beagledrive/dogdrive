# FPGA

Make the build file using *make*. 
Load the build file using *sudo make load*.

All code is located in *top.v* and *gpmc-sync.v*. The file *pwm.v* is only historical and does not contain any functionality. 

The files stored in folder *sensor_untested* are provided here for reference, however, they have not been tested on the beagleWire nor integrated and no functionality can be assumed.
